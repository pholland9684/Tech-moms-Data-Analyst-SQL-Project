# Data Analyst SQL Project: Tech-Moms Data Analysis using Deepnote 
  
  Project Overview:

  In this project, I utilized SQL within the Deepnote platform to analyze data provided by Tech-Moms, an organization focused on supporting women transitioning into tech careers.
  The goal was to explore various aspects of the Tech-Moms applicants' demographics, income levels, and family structures to better understand their needs and improve program 
  outreach and efficiency. This project answered a series of questions using SQL queries to gain insights into the applicants and their backgrounds.

  Data Source:

  The dataset consists of information about the applicants who have applied to the Tech-Moms program, including details about their cohort assignments, income levels, family status, and education.

  Key Questions Answered:

  1.  Total Applications Received:
        How many applications has Tech-Moms received?
  
  2.  Applicants Assigned to Cohorts:
        How many applicants were assigned a cohort?

  3.  Support for Children:
        How many children are supported through Tech-Moms programs?

  4.  Income Analysis:
        What is the total number of students that make less than $50K?
        What is the total number of students by household income?
        What is the percentage of household income less than $15K?

  5.  Family Structure:
        How many applicants that are in cohorts are single?
        How many applicants that are in cohorts are married?
        What is the average number of children among all applicants?
        What is the most number of children of any applicant?
 
  6.  Demographic Insights:
        What is the total count of students assigned to a cohort who are BIPOC?
        What is the percentage of applicants in cohorts that are single?
        What is the percentage of applicants in cohorts that are BIPOC?
 
  7. Education and Resources:
        How many applicants have a bachelor's degree?
        How many students own a laptop?
  
  8.  Cohort-Based Income Analysis:
        What are the household incomes of those in cohorts?
 
  9.  Tools and Technologies Used:
        SQL: All the queries to answer the questions were written in SQL.
        Deepnote: The platform used to run the SQL queries, visualize results, and manage the workflow.

Outcome:
  The SQL queries provided key insights into the applicant pool, allowing Tech-Moms to better understand their applicants' demographic distribution,   
  economic background, and family structure. These insights can help tailor the program's resources and support to best meet the needs of its participants,  
  ensuring a more impactful experience for applicants and their families.
